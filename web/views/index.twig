        <p>She is in three clubs at NJIT. Those clubs are Nucleus Yearbook, Filipinos in Newark
        Engaging in Socialcultural Traditions (FINEST) and Women in Computing Society (WiCS). In yearbook, she is
        part of the business committee and works on such tasks like taking care of the yearbook's social media and
        hanging flyers throughtout the campus. In FINEST, she meets new Filipinos and non-Filipinos, helping her
        to come out of her shell and socialize. In WiCS, she meets new connections and learns about opportunities
        to further herself in her field.</p>

    Please do work through the Getting Started guide, even if you do know how to build such an application.  The guide covers the basics of working with Heroku, and will familiarize you with all the concepts you need in order to build and deploy your own apps.
